Certainly! Here's an example of how the code could be refactored using the Factory Method design pattern:

```python
# Corrected Code Snippet

class Item: # any product can be
    def __init__(self, price):
        self.price = price


class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        self.total_price = 0

    def add_item(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
        self.total_price += item.price

    def remove_item(self, item):
        self.items.remove(item)
        self.total_price -= item.price

    def calculate_discount(self):
        if self.total_price > 100:
            return self.total_price * 0.1
        else:
            return 0

    def checkout(self):
        final_price = self.total_price - self.calculate_discount()
        print(f"Total price: {self.total_price}")
        print(f"Discount applied: {self.calculate_discount()}")
        print(f"Final price after discount: {final_price}")


class ItemFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_item(price):
        return Item(price)


# Usage
shopping_cart = ShoppingCart()

# Create items using the factory method
item1 = ItemFactory.create_item(50)
item2 = ItemFactory.create_item(30)
item3 = ItemFactory.create_item(25)

# Add items to the shopping cart
shopping_cart.add_item(item1)
shopping_cart.add_item(item2)
shopping_cart.add_item(item3)

# Checkout
shopping_cart.checkout()
```

Explanation:
In the refactored code, we introduced the `Item` class to represent individual items with their corresponding prices. We also added the `ItemFactory` class, which serves as the factory responsible for creating instances of the `Item` class.

By implementing the Factory Method design pattern, we achieve separation of concerns and encapsulation. The creation logic for `Item` objects is now centralized in the `ItemFactory`, making it easier to modify or extend the creation process in the future.

To use the factory method, we call `ItemFactory.create_item(price)` to create an instance of `Item` with the given price. We can then add these items to the shopping cart and perform other operations as before.

This refactoring improves the code by adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle and enhances flexibility for future changes, such as adding new item types or modifying the creation process.
